Examples of some of my coding projects in C and python, the most important project is Group-size: it determines the size of a subgroup of Sn that is 
generated by some elements of Sn (input is given in the form of a matrix, rows representing permutations). It does this by inductively finding the orbit of n, 
and a set of permutations which generate the stabiliser of n and multiplying these.

At each stage the 'permutation stripping algorithm' is used to ensure the number of generators is minimal, so the program is efficient.
